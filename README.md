# shareddit bookmarklet

shareddit is a basic bookmarklet, and now extension, that creates a drop-down menu on every comment in a thread for automatically generated submission forms targeted at simplifying submissions to /r/bestof, /r/nocontext, and /r/retiredgif using automatically generated templates, as well as the option to submit using a generic template to any other subreddit. A hotlink to x-post links, with autogenerated submission forms, is also generated while using the script.

The extensions have a duplicate submission blocking system in place, while the bookmarklet no longer has this feature because the randomly generated string is unable to be automatically removed from the submission page causing issues with the link later on.

## Setup

Pick a browser and install the extension. More features are in the works, but as this is just a fun learning experiment at the moment, homework assignments come first.

Or if you would prefer, you can put the source code on your own server (but then you don't get cool new features!), otherwise just make a new bookmark and set the URL to this (link last updated October 2, 2015):

    javascript:void($.getScript('https://cdn.rawgit.com/iGGNoRe/shareddit/master/main.js'))

## Use comment sharing

1. Open a thread, or a user's profile page
2. Click the bookmark
3. Use the newly created drop-down box to select the destination
4. Enter how many comments to use for context
5. Fill in the description template if it is going to /r/bestof, or /r/retiredgif
6. Submit

## Use x-post sharing

Now supports self posts, and doesn't remove expando buttons.

1. Click the bookmarklet either on the subreddit's listing page, or inside the comment page of the link
2. Click on the newly generated hotlink that says "x-post this link"
3. Fill in the destination sub
4. Submit
